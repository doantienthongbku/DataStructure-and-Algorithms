# Backtracking-1

## **Problem**
Given a N*N board with the Knight placed on the first block of an empty board.
Moving according to the rules of chess knight must visit each square exactly once.
Print the order of each cell in which they are visited.

## Example:
```
Input : 
    N = 8
Output:
    0  59  38  33  30  17   8  63
    37  34  31  60   9  62  29  16
    58   1  36  39  32  27  18   7
    35  48  41  26  61  10  15  28
    42  57   2  49  40  23   6  19
    47  50  45  54  25  20  11  14
    56  43  52   3  22  13  24   5
    51  46  55  44  53   4  21  12
```

## General Algorithms

```
while there are untried tours
{ 
   generate the next tour 
   if this tour covers all squares 
   { 
      print this path;
   }
}
```

## Backtracking Algorithm for Knightâ€™s tour 

```
If all squares are visited 
    print the solution
Else
   a) Add one of the next moves to solution vector and recursively check if this move leads to a solution. (A Knight can make maximum eight moves. We choose one of the 8 moves in this step).
   b) If the move chosen in the above step doesn't lead to a solution then remove this move from the solution vector and try other alternative moves.
   c) If none of the alternatives work then return false (Returning false will remove the previously added item in recursion and if false is returned by the initial call of recursion then "no solution exists" )
```
